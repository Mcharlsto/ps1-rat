# Horizontally spinning rat - now on your... PS1!

A PS1 port of the horizontally spinning rat meme, because sanity is overrated anyway.

## Usage

To run, fire up a PS1 emulator - I recommend [PCSX-Redux](https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux), then use the "load binary" menu to run [the PS-EXE file](https://github.com/Mcharlsto/ps1-rat/releases/download/1.0.1/RAT.ps-exe).

If you're insane and want to run this on real hardware, burn the .ISO or BIN/CUE file to a CD and fire it up on a modchipped console.
